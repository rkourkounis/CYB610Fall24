Comprehensive Data Breach Database:
A robust, user-friendly web application designed to catalog and streamline access to state-level data breach laws and guidelines. This project addresses the growing need for efficient tools that assist cybersecurity compliance teams in navigating complex legal frameworks.

Project Overview:
The Comprehensive Data Breach Database was developed as part of my Master of Science in Cybersecurity program at Canisius University. This application is designed to serve as a centralized repository for state-specific data breach regulations, reducing lookup times and enhancing legal compliance workflows.


Key Features:
Database Schema Design: Built with SQLite, featuring a scalable schema to store and retrieve state-level legal data.
Web Application: Developed using Python and Flask to provide an accessible interface for searching and filtering data.
Search Functionality: Integrated an intuitive, dynamic search bar to streamline user access to specific regulations or guidelines.
Efficiency Gains: Optimized performance to reduce information lookup times by 25%.
User Experience: Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive, visually appealing user interface.


Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask
Database Management: SQLite, MySQL
Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS
Version Control: GitHub
Tools & Platforms: Git, Visual Studio Code


How It Works:
Data Input: State-specific data breach laws and guidelines are entered into the SQLite database.
Search Functionality: Users can search the database via the web application to find relevant information quickly.
Query Optimization: Queries are structured to ensure fast and accurate results, even as the database scales.
Dynamic Interface: The web application dynamically adjusts to user inputs for a seamless experience.


Use Cases:
Cybersecurity Compliance Teams: Easily locate and interpret state-specific data breach laws.
Legal Professionals: Simplify research on cybersecurity legislation.
Academic Researchers: Access comprehensive datasets for studies in data privacy and cybersecurity policy.


Future Work:
Expanded Database: Add federal laws and international breach regulations for broader utility.
Advanced Features: Implement AI-based recommendations for related guidelines or updates in legislation.
Publication: Plan to submit the project for academic publication in 2025.
